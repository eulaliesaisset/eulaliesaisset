I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Sciences Po (Centre for Research on Social Inequalities) and CIRED, under the supervision of [Lucas Chancel](https://lucaschancel.com/) (PSE & Sciences Po) and [Harold Levrel](https://www.centre-cired.fr/harold-levrel/) (AgroParisTech & CIRED). My research is funded by the French Ministry for Ecological Transition, where I work in an operational department in charge of territorial planning and biodiversity conservation policies.

My work involves studying the equity issues in policies preventing land artificialisation in France, within the global context of addressing land degradation and biodiversity loss. My research interests lie at the intersection between environmental justice, land economics and biodiversity conservation. Currently, I am working on the link between land take and land taxation, looking at the redistribution of fiscal income.

I hold a master's degree in engineering from Mines Paris and a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics and previously worked at the World Bank, the think tank La Fabrique de l'industrie, and the environmental consultancy I Care & Consult.
